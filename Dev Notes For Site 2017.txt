Sep Week 1 Dev notes for site

- make the text on page 1 one-third of total page width
	(either manually or using bootstrap)
	
	- DONE
	
- add navbar to be able to switch between pages.
	- DONE for the first page
	
- Add bootcamp ref to other pages, then copy navbar there too.
	- DONE
	
- Pick a colour palette
	- yellow + blue-purple + red-purple
	
- Try a combo of colours
	- yellow background, red-purple top banner
	- then darker (orangish) yellow with marine blue
	
	- DONE
	
- fix the navbar text so it is readable colour

	- DONE
	
- Make alternative colour scheme (then add a button to switch)

	- Button added
	- Colour added
	- DONE
	
- Desiderata for site: 
	- button at bottom of front page saying 'How do you pronounce your name?' that brings up pronounciations text
	- interactable graphic showing skill breakdown in front page
	- interactable graphic per skill / project
	- put the "chance colour scheme" button somewhere more streamlined
	- put more games up
	- keep in mind shadow effects (check landing page code-along for deets)
	
- Review stuff, including paper.js and jquery

Make the visual for skill division: 

1. Make one arc by using formulae
2. Make as many arcs as skills to highlight
3. Animate it
4. figure out on-hover
5. add on-hover effect (by toggling class?)

1. DONE


2. DONE

Gitify website folder, and upload to github

- Gitification DONE

- Upload DONE

[Oct 25]

stop on hover, done

Next up: 

write all skills and span them
get them to highlight when hover over corresponding gear. 
then draw the line using path stuff. 

not working (paper hover). Can't even get console logs from it. 

Next: either debug using paper mouse events + colour change, or with console log js message as accessed by paperscript

first one works:

function onMouseDown(event)
            {
                console.log("clicked");

                if (allPaths[0].contains(event.point)){
                    allPaths[0].strokeColor = 'black';
                    
                }
                else
                {
                    allPaths[0].strokeColor = 'green';
                    
                }

            }
	
Oct 30:

- next step: find some sort of icons (images, graphics) for skills page and projects

DONE

Oct 31:

temporary hosting up. list of issues:

burger isn't working,
not optimization for mobile
contact form goes nowhere
contact form font is all wrong
games not up (duh)
XP page needs to hide some of the info

Nov 1:

For mobile optimization: 
- fix the burger
- adjust skills page for consistency in mobile
	- resize icons according to screensize
	- pull / push to rearrange icon-text
- work on front page

burger fixed. new issue:
- standardize (and shrink?) photos in bosses page to be mobile appropriate
- adjust "pronounciation" box so that it is in the layout properly


Staged changes: 
	- burger interactable
	- thumbnail'd pictures and set their background transparent
	- skill tree layout fixed, hopefully also on mobile
	- changed Professional Experience to Career for better layouting.
	- changes to front page to make it ... better? yeah, sort of. good (ish) layout now.

I wonder if I can get an Icon on the tab heading.

anyway, time to commit the mobile optimization and burger.

feedback from parents:
- add image indentifier: check if can add image to navbar
- justify on both sides of paragraph
- move icons on skillpage to vertical middle (maybe even horizontal middle)
- grammar: days instead of day. 
- caption embot image

feedback from Andrew:

- attach normal resume in pdf format
- include buzzwords (especially frameworks)
- (maybe link to linkdin)
- in home page: write what you are seeking (not just doing)
- (Angular.js instead of complaining about js?)
- less woohoo-ey, more actual words
- swap programming and Game dev sections, with emphasis on programming

feedback from mike sutton:

- change colour spinner
- remove "stuff" and bracketed parts, for the sake of formality.

from heech:
- linkedin, git links. pdf of resume.
- make navigation easier on mobile.

from Mike wang:
- bullets or highlights to pop up key phrases

Staged changes:
- added icons with links for linkedin and github



[Nov 12]

- Big next changes to make: 
	change colour of spinners
	tighten language + buzzwords
	in home page write also what you are seeking 
	add image indentifier of self
	justify on both sides of paragraph
	move icons on skillpage to vertical middle (maybe even horizontal middle)
	grammar: days instead of day. 
	caption embot image
	
Find the long home (test both services)

Nov 14: 

list of completed tasks:
	- some language tightened up
	- wrote what I am seeking
	justified on both sides.
	icon centered 
	captioned image
