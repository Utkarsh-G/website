        Em-Bot
        </h3>

        <p class="projectdesc">
            Second-year project, widely considered the sole reason why 2nd year EngSci is called the "toughest year." 
            My reason for pride in this project is not because of the macho pride of doing something tough. 
            It's because the project was finished and functional. 
            I really hadn't expected to make a fully-finished and working robot in the span of four months.
            But that's just what my team (of three) did end up doing. 

            Oh and what it was: a candy vending machine that would dispense candy to children based on how many math questions that they could solve.
            The parents, with their special login, could set the level of math for each child, and even assign points per candy redeemed to account for candy preferences among their children.
            
            My part in it: I did all the electrical circuits: designed, implemented, and tested. My teammate, John, did the woodwork for the hardware frame, and the other teammate, Barsan, did the programming for accounts login and configuration.

        Bugzilla Custom Installation
        </h3>

        <p class="projectdesc">
            While there were other projects at Bell Canada that were more exciting, took up more time, and had more of an impact on the customers, the Bugzilla project remains one that I'm most proud of.
            The first reason is because I saw the project through from beginning to completion. I proposed the solution, and executed it to fulfill our team's needs.
            The second reason is because even though it didn't directly affect the customers, it did have a clear and beneficial impact on the members of my team. It made bug tracking a lot more painless.

            What it was: A custom installation of Bugzilla on Fedora local server, along with the extra feature of setting up a redundancy MySQL server. 

            My part in it: I was the sole person responsible for it.

        XMY Game

            <div class="col-md-6">
        <p class="projectdesc">
            My second big game project. The first one ran into a lot of trouble because of my lack of experience. 
            It would have been easy to give up at this point and pursue a safer project. 
            But instead, I took note of everything that went wrong and made plans to improve on it. 
            And it worked. 
            Over the next year, not only did I build a whole new codebase for a whole new game, but I tempered the development with a lot of learning, especially on clean code and Test-Driven Development.

            What it is: A game of navigating a social event via dialogue interaction, and playing cards that reflect your personality. 
            It has some pretty nifty character dynamics happening in the background, which I modeled after realworld interactions.

            My part in it: All of it. I chose a project that put emphasis on programming and creative writing (dialogue that builds and reflects character) because those are my strong points.
