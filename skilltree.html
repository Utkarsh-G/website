        <h3 class="skill"> Programming </h3>

        <p class="skilldesc"> Or "development" or whatever is the hip thing to call it these day. I have solid experience in C#, C++. I have also used Scheme, ML, Java in the past. 
            Over the last two and half years of programming, I've really learned to appreciate unit-tests and TDD, not to mention the value of clean, readable code. See my experience page for more info.
            I'm fairly new to JavaScript but I'm quickly getting the hang of it. So far the hardest thing to get over in Javascript is how loosely structured everything is. 
            How the heck do big teams use something so "wooo oooooh"-ey? After getting a couple of projects down with Javascript (including this site), I plan on jumping to TypeScript to see if it is something I'm more comfortable with.
            And if you have any suggestions, or ways to accept JS as it is, please do send them to me via the contact page.

        <h3 class="skill"> Game Dev </h3>

        <p class="skilldesc">
        I've done a bunch of projects using Unity and C#. Because I've been flying solo, I've had to get comfortable with all aspects of game dev. 
        I've found that I really relish the design and the programming parts of it. 
        I don't mind doing stuff like animation or music, but I know my limits. 
        The small projects have been instrumental in teaching me how things fit together. 
        The big projects have provided most of the growth though. 
        Stuff like working with large code-bases without letting them get fragile, asset and reference management, the value of Scritable Objects in Unity, it all came from experience in making these games.

            Web Dev

        <p class="skilldesc">
            My newest endeavor. I'm comfortable enough on the front-end side to make my own websites (including this one) without using templates. 
            Currently learning backend technologies because I do want that full-stack moniker. 
            Working on learning MEAN stack. From what I hear, some of that stuff is being replaced by React. I'll have to learn that after I finish the node.js stuff. (Y U so capricious, comp engg??)

            Storyteller
        </h3>
        
        <p class="skilldesc">
               I love story in all its form. From books I learned the myriad ways stories can be told in words. 
               Games and movies taught me how much narrative can be found outside of words. 
                And I try to use these lessons to add story to all my creative endeavors: speaking at Toastamsters, making games, building webpages, writing short fiction. 
                Not every story will appeal to everyone. Yet it only takes one person connecting with the style and substance of a story for the magic to happen.

            Computer Networking
        </h3>
        
        <p class="skilldesc">
            Networking was my first love when it came to Computer Engineering. Even now that I've expanded what Comp Engg means to me, it still holds a special place in my heart. 
            I love everything from traffic shaping to media protocols, from setting up routers to analyzing wireshark traces. 
            For a good three years (2013-2016) I was even CCNA certified.
            The only reason I moved away from this was because I wanted more control over design aspect of engineering, and I think that's easier to get in Web Dev and Game Dev.

            Communication
        </h3>
        
        <p class="skilldesc">
            I have three separate awards (CC, ACB, ACS) in Public Speaking from Toastmasters, and I'm working on a fourth one right now. 
            While I was always an avid public speaker, it was only through Toastmasters that I learned to refine my skills like a craft.
            This applies not only to prepared speeches, but also to speaking off the cuff. The latter used to give me much more anxiety than the former, until I learned to overcome my fears by constant practice.
            And no matter what field one works in, verbal communication is just so important that I think everyone should be practising it though not necessarily at Toastmasters.
            I think the biggest asset I bring to any work or team dynamic is the lack of fear of communication.

        </h3>
        
        <p class="skilldesc">
            I love creative writing. I like organizing intimate social events. My preferred ways of staying active are biking, hiking, and swimming. 
            I'm also a big foodie, leaning more towards savoury than sweet. I can speak French and Hindi at an intermediate level. 
            And I rarely miss Anime North anytime it comes to town.
