        <h1> Professional Experience</h1>
        
    <p> 
        The following is a list of my professional engineering experiences in reverse chronological order. If you want the story-mode version, then read from the bottom up.
    </p>
    <h3> Game Developer	Mar 2015 – Present </h3>

    <p class="subheading"> Self-Employed, Mississauga, Ontario
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>    Developed multiple games using C# and Unity Editor
        </li>
        <li>    Rigorously followed Test-Driven Development (TDD) via Unity Test Tools
        </li>
        <li>    Coded enemy AI and card game mechanics
        </li>
        <li>    Developed website to showcase projects
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="addedcolour"> It started as a fun little six-month long project to make a game. By the end of the first six months, my code-base had spiralled out of control into a fragile incomprehensible mess, and I realized I didn't have the animation skills to make the game a reality on my own.
        So I started afresh on a new project: much less focus on animation / music / anything I couldn't create myself, and far more focused on coding style, cleanliness, and robustness. I am now a total convert to the cult of Test Driven Development. 
        TDD + Clean coding techniques have turned my work into a pleasant romp. Adding feature or refactoring is so much quicker with clean, readable code, and it is entirely painless with a healthy set of unit-tests present as safety nets. 
        I've also worked on smaller games along the way just to learn more about Unity and C#. Some of them are showcased on this site.
    </p>

    <h3>Applications Engineer	Nov 2013 – Dec 2014
    </h3>
    <p class="subheading">Calnex Solutions, Linlithgow, Scotland and Ottawa, Ontario
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>    Designed lab test environments around the Attero product line
        </li>
        <li>    Managed technical support and technical sales for the Attero
        </li>
        <li>    Troubleshot customer issues
        </li>
        <li>    Directed features development
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="addedcolour"> It was the chance to travel to Scotland that drew me to this opportunity. It was also in my field of Computer Networking - I had a CCNA back then, and I had taken a lot of networking courses in my final year at university. 
        I gained a fair amount of technical knowledge of the IP backhaul of mobile networks. Working with our clients like Cisco and AT&amp;T, I also got to apply the theory of networking like traffic shaping. 
        Unfortunately, the job started to drift more towards sales than I was comfortable with. After leaving the company, I decided to go back to my roots and try my hand at something much more technical.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
    Applications Architect	May 2010 – Jun 2011
    </h3>

    <p class="subheading">Bell Canada, Toronto, Ontario
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>    Automated Quality Assurance on the Routing Gateways (RG) using Tcl and AutoIT
        </li>
        <li>    Reverse engineered IPTV technology to pin point bottlenecks
        </li>
        <li>    Proposed and developed a bug tracking solution with real-time backups
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="addedcolour"> 
        My time at Bell Canada was a great professional experience. As a student-intern for 14 months, I got to learn a lot, and also got to feel the excitment of working on a product that directly impacted the consumers. 
    The best thing for me was the diversity of technical challenges - from analyzing wireshark traces, to automating hardware and also application-level QA, I was always applying and expanding my problem solving and design skills. 
    The experience was so fulfilling that it motivated me to take more Networking courses upon returning to school.
